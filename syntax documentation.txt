#here is the note of the syntax

for when-statement:

when;{condition}:
    {code}
    End

log:

log:content

and:

x&&y

or:

x||y

for the remaining just go read my code, it ain't that long, too lazy to write a documentation lol, plus most of them
works like a combine of python, C++, and some of my own syntaxes
