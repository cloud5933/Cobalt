the compiler is "runner.py"

if you wanna check the code of the compiling, go to "syntax.py", and yes i finally fixed the typo :D
YAYYYY :DDDDDDDDD

if you wanna try it out yourself just write your code in "cobaltTestFile.cb"

and go to syntax documentation.txt(yes I fixed the typo here too :D) for the syntax documentation... not really... you'll know what I
meant soon :3

there's a single dependant:
colorama

I added it for the red color on error messages, nothing important, you can manually remove it if you want to
