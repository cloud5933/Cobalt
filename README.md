the compiler is "runner.py"

if you wanna check the code of the compiling, go to "syntex.py", and yes I know I spelt it wrong I'm just too
lazy to change it :P

if you wanna try it out yourself just write your code in "cobaltTestFile.cb"

and go to syntex.txt(spelt it wrong again :P) for the syntax documentation... not really... you'll know what I
meant soon :3
